Important: run this in an Interactive Terminal or the data plots won't show!

# Overview
The data set I used contains the CO2 emissions of 256 different countries and territories between 1960 and 2019. It also differentiates between economic classes, multi-national 
conglomerates, and larger geographical territories. The data set can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ulrikthygepedersen/co2-emissions-by-country?resource=download

I've taken some data visualization classes while in college, but I've never used a program to analyze data sets. I know some libraries that can do this are quite powerful,
and so wanted to see exactly what I could do with one.

# Data Analysis Results

I wanted to answer a couple questions with this project:
1. What were the top 5 countries that produced the most CO2 between the years of 1960 and 2019? 
  - In order from most to least produced, the United States, China, the Russian Federation, the Middle East and North Africa and India produced the most CO2 in that timespan.
2. Which country in those top 5 had the greatest percent increase in carbon emissions between 2009 and 2019?
  - India had the greatest overall increase within that decade (46.5%) while the United States had the lowest increase (-6.3%). 

# Development Environment
I used Visual Studio Code as my editor for this project, as its interactive terminal for Python made data visualization much easier than some alternatives. 

I wrote this program in Python using the Pandas library.

# Useful Websites
A list of some sites and guides I found useful: 
* [Toward Data Science's Pandas Tutorial](https://towardsdatascience.com/getting-started-to-data-analysis-with-python-pandas-with-titanic-dataset-a195ab043c77)
* [Pandas official documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/10min.html#min)
* [RealPython's Pandas Plot guide](https://realpython.com/pandas-plot-python/)

# Future Work

Some things to fix later on:
* My data plots aren't the clearest; they show enough to get the point across but not well. 
* I feel like I've only scratched the surface of what Pandas can do for data visualization, especially if I used it in conjunction with something like Tableau.
